# superluminar hiring tasks

As part of our hiring process we are kindly asking you to take a look a the following tasks.

Please choose a lambda task based on which technology you are most comfortable with. The choices are:

- [CloudFormation stack with NodeJS Lambda](./lambda-nodejs/Readme.md)
- [CloudFormation stack with Python Lambda](./lambda-python/Readme.md)
- [CDK stack with TypeScript / NodeJS Lambda](./lambda-node-cdk/Readme.md)

As a second step, please take a look at the [VPC task](./vpc/Readme.md).

## Important to note

It is not necessary to "complete" the task and create a working version of the code.
For us, it is more important, to have a relatively deep technical conversation about the used technologies with you.
